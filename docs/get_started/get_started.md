## Installing the compiler

https://qat.dev/downloads lists all the versions available for the compiler. It is recommended that you pick the latest version so as to get the latest features and to avoid bugs/problems.

Make sure that the folder/directory that contains the executable of the compiler is added to the PATH variable of your system. This makes it possible for you to invoke the compiler by using the `qat` command without specifying the full path to the executable. If you face issues that seems to be unsolveable on your end, please open an issue [here](https://github.com/qatlang/qat/issues/new/choose) to seek help

Please select your platform from the list below:

- [Linux](/get_started/linux_installation)
- [Windows](/get_started/windows_installation)
- MacOS

## Tools

At the moment, the language only has minimal IDE integration support. If you are using VSCode
as your IDE, congrats, there is an official extension for the language available
[here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=aldrinsartfactory.qat)
which has code highlighting, and analysis support (errors & warnings)
