## Installing the compiler

https://qat.dev/downloads lists all the versions available for the compiler. It is recommended that you pick the latest version so as to get the latest features and to avoid bugs/problems. If you face issues during installation that seems to be unsolveable on your end, please open an issue [here](https://github.com/qatlang/qat/issues/new/choose) to seek help

Please select your platform from the list below to get detailed steps regarding the installation:

- [Windows](/get_started/windows_installation)
- [Linux](/get_started/linux_installation)
- MacOS

## Tools

At the moment, the language only has minimal IDE integration support. If you are using VSCode as your IDE, congrats, there is an official extension for the language available [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=aldrinsartfactory.qat) which has code highlighting, and analysis support (errors & warnings)
