The `bool` keyword represents the boolean datatype. This is a popular datatype in many programming languages. The value of `bool` type can either be `true` or `false`. These two values are also called boolean literals.

This is a specialisation of `u1`, the 1-bit unsigned integer. The distinction between `u1` and `bool` exists in the typesystem and values of these types can be losslessly converted between each other.
